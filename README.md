# Monte Carlo Simulation with GBM for Bancolombia Stock Prices (CIB)

This project uses Monte Carlo simulation with the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model to construct different scenarios for the closing prices of Bancolombia's stock.

## Description:

Monte Carlo simulation is a technique used to model the evolution of asset prices under uncertainty. In this project, the GBM model is implemented to generate multiple simulated trajectories of future closing prices for Bancolombia's stock. This methodology is useful for assessing potential future price scenarios and managing investment risks.

## Usage:

- Download Data: The project uses the yfinance library to download historical closing price data for Bancolombia.

- Monte Carlo Simulation: Monte Carlo simulation is performed using the GBM model. Multiple future price trajectories are generated from the current closing price.

- Visualization: The simulation results are visualized in graphs showing the simulated price trajectories.
